# Language Classification with NLP

A machine learning project for identifying languages in text.
Exploring language prediction through Naive Bayes classification and basic text vectorization.
An NLP-based approach to classify and detect multiple languages from short text inputs.

## Features
- Vectorizes raw text input using **CountVectorizer**
- Trains a **Naive Bayes** classifier
- Splits dataset into training and test sets
- Interactive: Type your own sentence to predict its language

---

## Goals
- Train a machine learning classifier  
- Evaluate model performance using train-test split
- Interact with real-time predictions

---

## Model Evaluation
- **Training Accuracy:** 0.99  
- **Testing Accuracy:** 0.95
